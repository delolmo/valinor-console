## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.1] - 2026-10-27

### Changed

- Same code as 2.6.0, republished from a history without the `.claude/` directory. 2.6.0 is withdrawn: its tag was moved after Packagist published it, and Packagist keeps published versions immutable.
- `.claude/` is ignored.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-10-27 [YANKED]

### Security

- Require PHP 8.4.27 or later on 8.4 and 8.5.12 or later on 8.5, the releases fixing CVE-2026-109618 and CVE-2026-109619.

### Changed

- Require `cuyz/valinor` 2.6 or later.
- `composer.json` declares the MIT license the package already shipped under.

### Fixed

- The README example used a wrong namespace, a syntax error and `enableFlexibleCasting()`, which Valinor 2 removed in favour of `allowScalarValueCasting()`.

## [2.3] - 2026-03-20

- Last release before this changelog.
